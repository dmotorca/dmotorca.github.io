        Hello Everyone, I am David Motorca and I prefer the pronouns he/him. I
        have been at PSU since 2019 and will hopefully be graduating this year.
        My ultimate job direction would be in an industry that is beneficial to
        the climate or environment. I understand that this direction is
        incredibly vague which is true but simply due to the fact that I don't
        really have a good idea for what exact industry/company I want to work
        at. Over this last summer, I interned at TigerStop in Washington, it was
        a great experience that really broadened my horizon/passion for embedded
        systems work. The company specializes in creating machines that mitigate
        waste material while simultaneously increasing production. I got to work
        on both the front-end and back-end for the project which was really
        awesome as I got to fully incorporate changes with the exact vision that
        I had. In addition, the application was launched on a linux system which
        was another challenge but is now ultimately a strength of mine as I am
        very comfortable developing on linux. I am never really sure on how to
        talk about my hobbies. I don't really have any unique hobbies which
        makes it difficult for me to share what I like to do without sounding
        like everyone else(which is not really a problem it just feels a little
        bland). I am looking forward to go skiing on Mount Hood this upcoming
        winter. During the summer months I really enjoy going on overnight
        backpacking trips. I also really enjoy playing video games whenever I
        have free time. I am currently playing Overwatch2 and I am looking
        forward to the release of God of War Ragnarok.
