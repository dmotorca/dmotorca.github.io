          <h2>HELLO ALL</h2>
          <p>
            I am David Motorca and I prefer the pronouns he/him. I have been at
            PSU since 2019 and will hopefully be graduating this year. My
            ultimate job direction would be in an industry that is beneficial to
            the climate or environment. I understand that this direction is
            incredibly vague which is true but simply due to the fact that I
            don't really have a good idea for what exact industry/company I want
            to work at. Over this last summer, I interned at TigerStop in
            Washington, it was a great experience that really broadened my
            horizon/passion for embedded systems work. The company specializes
            in creating machines that mitigate waste material while
            simultaneously increasing production. I got to work on both the
            front-end and back-end for the project which was really awesome as I
            got to fully incorporate changes with the exact vision that I had.
            In addition, the application was launched on a linux system which
            was another challenge but is now ultimately a strength of mine as I
            am very comfortable developing on linux. I am never really sure on
            how to talk about my hobbies. I don't really have any unique hobbies
            which makes it difficult for me to share what I like to do without
            sounding like everyone else(which is not really a problem it just
            feels a little bland). I am looking forward to go skiing on Mount
            Hood this upcoming winter. During the summer months I really enjoy
            going on overnight backpacking trips. I also really enjoy playing
            video games whenever I have free time. I am currently playing
            Overwatch2 and I am looking forward to the release of God of War
            Ragnarok.
