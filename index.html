          <p>
            Hello, thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio website.
            My name is David Motorca and I studied at Portland State University
            from 2019 - 2023. I gradudated in June of 2023 with a Bacheleor
            degree in Computer Science. In the summers, I really enjoy going
            backpacking in forests all throughout the PNW, playing basketball,
            or just simply being near a body of water. As the seasons change and
            the weather starts to get more cold, I enjoy spending my time skiing
            at Mount Hood. Whenever I have some downtime, I really enjoy playing
            single-player games such as God of War, CyberPunk 2077, and
            Baulder's Gate 3.
          </p>

              TigerStop is a company that specializes in creating machines and
              devices to simplfy work and reduce the amount of waste from
              materials. At the internship I specifically worked on creating
              their next SawGear product which included working on both the
              frontend and the backend while deploying the device on a linux
              based system. One of my most proud achievements during this
              internship, was the fact that during alpha development, I had
              found a solution to automatically download excel files that
              contained a parts-list for a certain job. This allowed a user to
              simply insert a USB stick and press a button to import a
              parts-list and the machine would simply start work based on these
              instructions. The version of the alpha that had this contribution
              was then displayed at the largest woodworking show in North
              America (IWF Atlanta).
